Compound Data Types
  Lists
  Tuples

  Tuples
    - an ordered sequence of elements, can mix element types
    - cannot change element values, immutable
    - use with parentheses ()

    te = ()     #empty typle
    t = (7, "Hi", 23)
    t[0]        # equals 7
    t2=(7,"Hi",23)+(5,6)  #t2=(7,"Hi",23,5,6)

    slices return a new object
    t[1:2] -> ("Hi",)  # the comma indicates that it is a Tuples

  Tuple Assignment

    b = ("Bob", 19, "CS")     # tuple packing
    (name, age, studies) = b  # tuple unpacking

    print(name)               # Bob
    print(age)                # 19

  Tuple Swap

    - conveniently used to swap variable values

    # won't work
    x = y
    y = x

    # will work
    temp = x
    x = y
    y = temp

    # will work with Tuples
    (x, y) = (y, x)

  Using Tuples

    def quotient_and_rem(x, y):
      q = x // y
      r = x % y
      return (q, r)

  Lists

    Object stored data in ordered sequence and accessible by index
      - list is denoted by square brackets, []
      - a list contains elements
      - a list may be heterogeneous or homogeneous

    L = []  # create an empty list
    L = [2, 'a', 4, [1,2]]  # a heterogeneous list with the 4th element being another list
    len(L)  # equals 4
    L[0]    # 2

      - Lists are mutable
      - assigning to a new element at an index changes the value
      L = [2, 1, 3]
      L[1] = 5
